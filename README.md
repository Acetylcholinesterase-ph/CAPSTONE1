# RFID-Based Recycling Reward System

## Overview

This project implements an RFID-based recycling reward system designed to encourage sustainable waste management practices. Users are rewarded for recycling by scanning their RFID cards when depositing recyclable items. The system tracks user activity and dispenses rewards based on the quantity and type of recyclables processed.

## Features

- **RFID Authentication:** Users identify themselves using RFID cards/tags.
- **Recyclable Detection:** System recognizes when recyclable items are deposited.
- **Reward Allocation:** Points or rewards are issued based on recycling activity.
- **User Tracking:** Each user's recycling history is recorded and viewable.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Administrators can monitor system usage and manage rewards.

## How It Works

1. **User Registration:** Each user is issued an RFID card registered in the system.
2. **Recycling Process:** Users scan their RFID card before depositing recyclables.
3. **Item Detection:** The system verifies and counts the recyclables.
4. **Reward System:** Based on deposited items, users earn points or vouchers.
5. **Data Storage:** All transactions are logged for analysis and reporting.

## Hardware Requirements

- RFID Reader and RFID Cards/Tags
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi)
- Sensors for recyclable item detection (e.g., IR, weight, or camera-based)
- Display (LCD/LED) for user feedback
- Reward dispensing mechanism (optional; e.g., printer for vouchers)

## Software Requirements

- Microcontroller Firmware (C/C++/Python)
- Backend Server (optional; for data storage and admin dashboard)
- Frontend (optional; for dashboard access)

## Getting Started

1. **Assemble the Hardware:** Connect RFID reader, sensors, and display to microcontroller.
2. **Install Software:** Upload firmware to microcontroller and set up backend dashboard (if applicable).
3. **Register Users:** Assign and register RFID cards/tags for users.
4. **Start Recycling:** Users can begin scanning their cards and recycling items to earn rewards.
